Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project was a hypothetical project attempting to set up a web based application for external customers and internal admins. 

The client was DriverPass itself. The objective was to create a customer portal where they could log on, purchase packages, schedule, cancel and reschedule appointments for services. As well as get up to date information from the DMV. Internally the web based application hoped to have a credential based log on feature, as well as the ability to connect drivers and respective cars with appointments. I feel like I had a very firm grasp on the management end of things, knowing what was needed to build the project and at what time things needed to be accomplished. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the Business Requirements Document from project one. I think refactoring is always good, however; I learned a lot in this course and could definitely fine tune this document to better meet client needs. For instance, my User Interface and System Background statements leave a lot of opened ended questions and left out details. I could greatly expand on this document in general. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When a contractor goes to build a structure, they do not go out and buy tools, sheet metal, two by fours, flooring, duct work, and hire skilled workers before understanding what they are building. Imagine a contractor building an industrial plant when the need was for residential homes. The core of any project is what does the user need, and what features are they going to be interacting with. While it’s great that a customer can schedule an online appointment, if they can’t pay for the appointment it does not meet the needs of DriverPass. All features externally and internally should be focused around the user needs of a project. Any features added after should be built around these core components. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

As a certified scrum master (CSM) I think I will always look at a project from a scrum/agile mindset. The software development lifecycle’s I learned about in this course gave me a better scope of how systems are built and are implemented. My general understanding has been requirement collection, analysis, designing, coding, testing, and maintenance. However, I see now that there are different ways to approach systems.
